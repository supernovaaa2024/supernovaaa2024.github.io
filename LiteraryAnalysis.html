What Contagious Diseases in The Plague and Angels in America Reveal about
Faith in the Divine and Humanity

“The just man need have no fear, but the evildoer has good cause to tremble. For plague is the flail of God and the world His threshing-floor, and implacably He will thresh out His harvest until the wheat is separated from the chaff.” This is Father Paneloux’s first sermon, delivered to offer solace to the citizens of Oran as he encourages them to have faith in the Divine during the Plague. But, when suffering is unbearably traumatic, is faith in the divine enough? When suffering occurs on a broad scale, are “evildoers” the only ones being punished? When our loved ones pass away from pestilences and hardships, is leaving everything to the divinity justifiable?
Having faith in a greater power has always alleviated some pressure from me and bestowed in me a greater belief in my ability to overcome challenges when pressure mounts. However, there comes a point when divine faith is insufficient, and one must embrace humanist faith and exercise one’s will and determination to overcome obstacles. In The Plague by Albert Camus and Angels in America by Tony Kushner, both authors employ methods of characterization, juxtaposition, metaphors, symbolism and diction choices to compel the readers to reconsider the notion of faith by questioning the sole reliance on theological faith, and embrace humanistic faith, that is faith in humanity, to take collective action to overcome adversity and forge a society rooted in inclusion and compassion.
To begin, the denial of theological faith and the celebration of humanist faith will be explored through The Plague. In Father Paneloux’s first sermon, where he attempts to offer comfort and solace to the citizens of Oran, the juxtaposition of “just man” and “the evildoer” reflects Paneloux’s theological faith that the plague is only a punishment to the “evildoers” and would not befall anyone who is “just,” revealing his belief that such pestilence is only a divine justice from God. To this extent, Father Paneloux embodies the philosophy of using theological faith as an answer to humans’ inexplicable, horrid suffering. Moreover, the diction choice “flail” of God and the metaphor of Earth as his “threshing-floor” paint an image of a farmer, on the “threshing floor” of a farmland, using a flail to separate the “wheat” from the “chaff”, which are metaphors for the “just man” and the “evildoers”. The image of God as a diligent farmer, the almost martial-like verb “thresh,” and the diction choice “implacably” together invoke the idea that God must exercise relentless effort to forcefully separate the righteous from the wrongdoers, and hence, a devastating “plague” might be the only resolution. Even such a “resolution” is callous, Father Paneloux suggests that humanity should have faith that whatever pain God inflicts upon them is justice. This sermon foreshadows the eventual repudiation of faith in the divine, as this is an idea the author repeatedly repudiates. Furthermore, this philosophy could also be interpreted through the lens of escapism: Leaving the unexplainable to theological faith relieves us from the mental toll that such suffering places on us, while allowing us to avoid the responsibility of saving those who are suffering and offload such tasks to divinity.
However, is it true that everyone suffering from the plague has wrongdoings? From the depiction of the death of the innocent child, it is evident that it is rather unjust to leave everything to faith. The death of M. Othon’s child is a striking repudiation of Father Paneloux’s idea that the Plague is simply a manifestation of God and humanity should have faith in any suffering brought about by him. When describing the child’s death, Camus writes: “Just then the child, as if he’d been bitten in the stomach, bent again with a spindly groan. He remained contracted like that for several long seconds, shaken with chills and convulsive trembling, as if his frail carcass bent under the furious winds of the plague and cracked under the repeated gusts of fever…whose flesh had melted away in forty-eight hours, the child in the devastated bed assumed the pose of a grotesque crucifixion…” The semantic field of agony and pain, illustrating the immense torment the child is experiencing created through diction choices such as “spindly groan,” “chills,” and “convulsive trembling” is strikingly terrifying, forcing the readers to confront with the unjustifiable suffering of an innocent child and thereby question the theological faith that suffering is an act of justice. The diction choices “melted away” and “forty-eight hours” create a sense of dire urgency as the disease worsens rampantly. By extension, this also serves as a microcosm for the fatal, rampant, and uncontainable spread of this disease on a societal level. The impossible reconciliation of the innocent child’s insurmountable pain with the deity of God and any theological meaning in his death further evokes pathos and catharsis among the readers. It suggests that having faith in some divine power is not enough in the face of such trauma.
Furthermore, using personification and metaphor to compare the plague to “furious winds,” Camus suggests that the plague acts like a supernatural force beyond humans’ control, thereby questioning how the divine has humanity’s best interest. The diction choice of “repeated gusts” also invokes the image of capricious weather, suggesting that the plague, which symbolizes the unforeseeable absurdity of life, inflicts never-ending pain on humanity. The diction choices of “cracked” the child’s “frail carcass” further emphasize his helplessness against such brutal force, illustrating the vulnerability and powerlessness of humans against life’s inherent chaos and the so-called “justice from God.” The description of the child as a “grotesque crucifixion” is also another questioning of theological faith. Crucifixion symbolizes redemptive suffering as it pertains to the remission of one’s past sins. However, the qualifier of “grotesque” creates a juxtaposition that distorts the noble cause of redemptive suffering because the child is innocent. After observing this scene, Father Paneloux admits, in his second sermon, that in fact divinity cannot explain such suffering, and through this change in his belief, Camus raises his skepticism regarding the limits of divine faith.
Not only the child, Tarrou, Dr Rieux’s wife, and many lawful citizens have fallen ill. Clearly, such pestilence befalls not just the “evildoers,” but also the “just man.” To this end, if theological faith is insufficient, an act of escapism, and is discouraged in such pestilence, what could be an alternative? By the response of Dr Rieux’s tireless fight against the plague, Jean Tarrou’s search for secular sainthood, and the communal fight of the sanitization squad, it is to have faith in humanity and communal rebellion against hardships. Justice can only be created if we actively seek to resolve such issues instead of relying on divine faith. To begin, Dr Rieux, in response to Father Paneloux’s belief that all suffering is justifiable, refuses to have faith in such ideologies and instead uses his humanist actions and scientific acumen to save people because it is “the health that interests (him), health above all.” Furthermore, Jean Tarrou’s search for “secular sainthood” as he tries to be a “saint without God” also provides an alternative to theological faith in times of crisis. To be exact, he organizes the sanitization squad, which works tirelessly to fight the plague. He does not leave the duty of magically curing the people to God, but instead has faith in their actions to save the people of Oran and manifests his faith through actions. One may wonder how is “sainthood without God” possible. The exchange between Tarrou and Rieux might provide an answer: “My question’s this,” said Tarrou.“Why do you yourself show such devotion, considering you don’t believe in God? … If he believed in an all-powerful God, he would cease curing the sick and leave that to Him.” Here, Rieux suggests that simply having faith that an “all-powerful” God has humanity’s best interests at heart is not sufficient; we must also have faith in ourselves and exercise our duty to save humanity, rather than relying on divinity.
Furthermore, he says that “One grows out of pity when it’s useless… To fight abstractio
n, you must have something of it in your own make-up.” Here, Rieux rejects the idea that the moment feels pity, is the moment you accept defeat. And to fight “abstraction,” that is, the vague and divine meaning of suffering, Father Paneloux first endorsed, one should instead ground one’s beliefs in humanist and pragmatic actions to save others from both the literal and metaphorical “plague” of life. This reflects the doctor’s belief that one should not yield to suffering as a form of divine justice but to stand by the patients and never declare a loss. Lastly, the report Rambert initially longs to escape but at last resorts to staying with the sanitization squad to help fight the plague, illustrating the contagious power of faith in the solidarity of humans in fighting for a better world. Through the actions and dialogue of these characters, Camus clearly conveys his view that divine faith is insufficient in times of crisis and that humanistic actions supersede divine reliance.
Similarly, in the post-modernist play Angels in America, Tony Kushner employs imagery and dialogue to illustrate the denial of theological faith. However, the questioning of divine faith is more direct as the author infuses supernatural and prophetic elements into the play. In the conversation between Louis and Belize after Louis has abandoned Prior, Louis posits that “There are no gods here, no ghosts and spirits in America, there are no angels in America…” The use of anaphora with the repetition of the phrase “no gods,” “no ghosts and spirits,” emphasizes Louis’s stark denial of the metaphysical aspect of society since they all pertain to the supernatural, which is central to this play yet is forcefully denied by Louis here, revealing his secular belief system and progressive thinking, and this also embodies Kushner’s advocacy for a more liberal and progressive society. Here, he also suggests that all issues related to their identity and race are political, not rooted in human connections or communal solidarity. However, this is proven to be nearsighted, as later in the play, they all find love and support from each other, reinforcing the importance of humanistic faith.
The prophetic element, in the form of the Angel’s arrival, is crucial in this play. The Angel’s prophecy, which conveys the idea of conservatism, is criticized through Prior’s rebellious and fearful reaction, as this play celebrates humanity’s progressivism. In contrast to the typical representation of an Angel, the “Angel” in this play is frightening and powerful, and the fact that the Angel coughs also hints at how heaven is “sick,” revealing its insufficiencies. This suggests that not everything can be left to the divinity but must be intervened in by humans. The Angels demand that humanity should stop moving forward, but Priors refutes this command by arguing that, “No. No, I want you to go away, you go away or I will, I’ll leave, I can leave, too.” The Angels are not presented as wise and loving, and the Angel’s demand for halting progress is an act of fearful reactionism due to God abandoning heaven. This sign of weakness, fear, and selfishness suggests that perhaps divine faith is not something one should rely on solely. Here, Prior’s fear and defiance in the Angel’s demand of halting progress again is telling of Prior’s determination and acknowledgment of society’s need to progress, thereby showing faith in the ability of humans to forge a better society, which is crucial in forging a more inclusive society against the widespread ignorance of AIDS in the 1980s. Finally, this tension between the divine and humanity is elevated as Prior expresses rage towards God in front of the Angels and says that “If God ever did come back… If after all this destruction, if after all the terrible days of this terrible century, He returned to see… how much suffering His abandonment had created, if all He has to offer is death, you should sue the bastard…” Here, the use of anaphora with “if after all,” is clearly another rejection of divine faith as Prior expresses his anger of how the divine could allow for such ignorance of AIDS and his community. Organized religion argues that things happen for a reason, and everything could be justified from a theological standpoint. However, through Prior’s anger, we see that such an argument is flawed because prejudice against people like Prior is unjust and has no theological justification. Prior then argues that “We can’t just stop. We’re not rocks. Progress, migration, motion is modernity…” Here, his rejection of the angel’s proposal is another suggestion that we must have faith in humanity’s ability to move away from old doctrine, to pave the way for a more inclusive society for people of all ethnicities and genders.
Faith in the divine is necessary in times of crisis as it offers solace and comfort. However, it alone is not enough when people suffer from large-scale crises like the plague, injustice, and ignorance during the AIDS crisis, humanistic faith is necessary. By using the “plague” as a symbol for human existence and the AIDS crisis as a focal point to question the sole reliance on divine faith, both authors urge us to embrace humanistic faith. After all, as Dr Rieux declares, “What we learn in time of pestilence: that there are more things to admire in men than to despise.” This is an invitation for readers to recognize that, although divine faith is necessary in providing us with solace, one must also realize the power of humanity, embrace the humanist faith, because believing in the power of communal solidarity and tangible actions is the first step to a better world filled with more compassion and inclusion.
